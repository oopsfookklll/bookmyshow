The shared dependencies in the "BookMyShow.py" file include:

1. Class Name: "BookMyShow" - This is the main class that will be implemented in the file.

2. Function Names: "gather" and "scatter" - These are the two main methods of the "BookMyShow" class. They are used to allocate seats to a group of spectators.

3. Variables: "n", "m", "k", "maxRow" - These are the parameters used in the "BookMyShow" class and its methods. "n" and "m" are used to initialize the object with the number of rows and seats per row. "k" and "maxRow" are used in the "gather" and "scatter" methods to allocate seats to a group of spectators.

4. Data Structures: A 2D array or matrix will be used to represent the concert hall with "n" rows and "m" seats per row. Each element in the array will represent a seat in the concert hall.

5. Return Values: The "gather" method returns an array of length 2 denoting the row and seat number of the first seat being allocated to the group. The "scatter" method returns a boolean value indicating whether all members of the group can be allocated seats.

6. Constraints: The constraints on the input parameters "n", "m", "k", and "maxRow" are shared across the "BookMyShow" class and its methods. These constraints will be used to validate the input parameters.
